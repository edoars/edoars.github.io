Welcome! I am a cryptographer at [Telsy](https://telsy.com) where I have been part of the Research Group since 2020.

From 2020 to 2024, I was a PhD student in Mathematics in the [CrypTO Group](https://crypto.polito.it/) (Cryptography and Number Theory Group) at [Polytechnic of Turin](https://polito.it).
My research interests are mainly in post-quantum cryptography, in particular the aggregation and optimization of digital signatures, and the design and security analysis of cryptographic protocols.

I also contributed to the NIST PQC submission [CROSS](https://cross-crypto.com).

Previously, I received a MSc degree in Mathematics from [University of Trento](https://unitn.it) in 2020, and a BSc degree in Mathematics from [Roma Tre University](https://uniroma3.it) in 2017.
